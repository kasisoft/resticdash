# ResticDash

## Motivation

[restic] itself is a popular backup tool which works pretty reliable and efficiently.
I'm running several backups in my homelab on a time schedule.
In general there shouldn't be any issue with that but how can I be sure?

That's where this dashboard comes in. It's meant to visually show if a backup ran in a specified timeframe. If it ran it's green and otherwise it will simply be red, so I might need to check in on that.

Another reason for this dashboard is the fact that Ilike to dabble in other unfamiliar technologies as I'm primarily a Java/Kotlin/Spring dev.
So this little dashboard serves as a useful playground and a way to practice other stuff.


## A note of caution

* I myself am neither a [python] nor a frontend developer. So the codebase is based upon a very small skillset.

* Everything is based on Linux as it's meant to be used for myself. However I appreciate any kind of feedback to improve or fix my codebase.

* The UI isn't very appealing as I clearly have no talent for visual stuff. Suggestions are welcome.



## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following directories:


### fs

This is a simple directory with several bash scripts used to setup some [restic] repositories which is useful for testing purposes.

Further information can be found here: [README.md](./fs/README.md)


### backend

The __backend__ has been written in [python] and provides a basic REST server as well as the frontend code.

Further information can be found here: [README.md](./backend/README.md)


### frontend

The __frontend__ has been written using [svelte] and especially Svelte 5 and it's runes which makes life for frontend developers much easier.

Further information can be found here: [README.md](./frontend/README.md)


### install

The __install__ directory is just a collection of scripts and files allowing to configure a Linux service making use of this dashboard.

Further information can be found here: [README.md](./install/README.md)
