# Building

Building is as simple as just calling the script [build.sh].
This will cause the backend exe (.pex) to be built as well as a build of the frontend code.
Based upon the version number within the frontends _package.json_ and the last commit id an archive _resticdash-<version>.tgz_ will be created.


[build.sh]: ./build.sh
